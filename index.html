                Nikola Tesla - Black and White HeadShotNikola Tesla was an extraordinary man.<br><br>

                Nikola Tesla accomplished more in his lifetime than many of us could ever hope to achieve in a 100
                lifetimes. Tesla held over 300 different patents, spanning several countries. From wireless technology
                to alternating current, electric motors, Radio, X-Rays, radar and laser technology…the list goes on.<br><br>

                Nikola Tesla’s work would go on to inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers. To this very
                day, his inventions continue to shape life as we know it. You can’t help but wonder what the world
                would have looked like today if Nikola Tesla would have been able to finish his experiments with free
                energy and long range wireless energy transfer.

                Here’s a brief look at Nikola Tesla’s fascinating life.</P>
